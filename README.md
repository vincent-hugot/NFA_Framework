# VH's NFA Library

This is my (Vincent Hugot) Python library for handling
Nondeterministic Finite Automata (**NFA**).

(Also: very preliminary and experimental support for Bottom-Up Tree Automata (**BUTA**)
and Term Rewriting Systems (**TRS**), Computation Tree Logic (**CTL**) model-checking,... ).

**Warning:**
These libraries are meant for use by my _**students and direct collaborators**_.
I do not offer any kind of support beyond that, save opening the code to whoever
might find interest in it, under the terms of the GPL 3.0.
There is, for now, no documentation outside of a few elements in my lecture notes,
accessible only to INSA CVL students. The API can and will change at any time, with no regard
for backwards compatibility.

**TLDR:** Use at your own risk :-)


## Installation


Linux (strongly recommended): Use the appropriate script in NFA_install_scripts.

Windows: tested once, it works. You'll need to get installers for pdftk and Python.

Mac: no idea. Figure it out.

### INSA Students (3A Languages Theory, or 4A Formal Verification):

Refer to the lecture notes on Celene, section on Lab Classes.


## Contributing

The _**install scripts and readme**_ really do "live" in this repository; by all means submit
pull requests (PR) for those.

However, as far as the Python files go, this is merely a read-only image of a few files
in my personal repository;
PRs here _may_ be used as a means of communication, but
will never be merged directly.

I do not expect or at all encourage external contributions. This is fundamentally
a _personal_ sandbox of a codebase that happens to be publicly accessible for convenience.
